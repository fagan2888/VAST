# VAST Challenge-Prepare CSV files to GBAD



The Visual Analytics Science and Technology 
(VAST) Challenge is an annual contest with the goal of advancing the field of visual analytics through competition. The VAST Challenge is designed to help researchers understand how their software would be used in a novel analytic task and determine if their data transformations, visualizations, and interactions would be beneficial for particular analytic tasks.

Provided python scripts are created to transform datasets which are given in the form of CSV as input to GBAD.
